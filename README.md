BYOB but please do BB

White Boarding

Grab a partner or two and have them pick a random question for you. Sites with problems of varying degrees of difficulty and solutions will be provided. Take an easy question and rock it. Take a hard one just to see how well you can do, knowing that not solving it costs you absolutly nothing... everyone else is probably playing smash bros anyways. Do the problem on your own, phone a friend, poll the audience, you are the master of your own reality and your lifelines are limited only by your imagination
SMASH BROS!

The main attraction. Blow off some steam and enjoy pixilated melees preformed by fictional characters. Will always try to provide controllers for everyone but anyone who owns their own is encouraged to bring it along.
